* You are licensed to use the installer to create one single End Product (PrestaShop server, single public IP address) for yourself or for one client. This means you are only allowed to use the install on a single server or IP address (a “single WordPess application”).

* You can create one server for a you or client with PrestaShop installer, and you can transfer that End Product to your client for any fee. This license is then transferred to your client install.

* This license applies in conjunction with the Openbridge Terms for your use of the PrestaShop installer. If there is an inconsistency between this license and the PrestaShop installer terms, this license will apply to the extent necessary to resolve the inconsistency.

* This license can be terminated if you breach it. If that happens, you must stop making copies of or distributing the End Product until you remove the Item from it.

* The author of the PrestaShop installer retains ownership of the PrestaShop installer but grants you the license on these terms. This license is between the author of the PrestaShop installer and you.
